# Number-Neural-Network
Uses handwritten numbers and guesses them using a numpy neural network from scratch
inputter.py uses processing to create a grid on which you can draw your number. The outputted data should then be fed into the main.py.
The application will then output the number it guesses.
Warning: might not be completely accurate as more training data should be given.
